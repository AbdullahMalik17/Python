# Python
Python is an interpreter language(a type of programming language where the code is compiled on the fly each time the program is run .)
## Anaconda Distributor 
It contains all the depencies of Python . In which , we don't want to install library . 
### In Anaconda Prompt
We give the command python , then it will give us us interface for python for coding . But there , It is for a little time . Our code is not saved in file . So , It is not a best way of coding .
## Google Colab 
It provides us online environment to execute python with all it's Depencies . we make a notebook like as a jupiter Notebook to write a code on it . 
# Extension of file
The extension of python file is .py 
# Command to run it in the code in anaconda 
       python file-name

# Jupyter Notebook 
It helps us to run our code individually . It helps us to divide our code in segment , that helps us in time saving .  
# Environment 
In Typescript , we make a package.json file to show what packages are installed . In python , there is no liked a file . If we install anything . It will install on your computer not a folder . We have report about versions of our libraries or tools . 
# Virtual Environment 
We make a virtual environment by the following commands in the Anaconda :-
           
           conda create -n name python==latest-version -y
           
We can activate and deactivate in our virtual environment by following commands ;-
- conda activate name
- conda deactivate name    
# Making file like a Package.json
Firstly , we make a file of txt , then write  the name of library or something and run the command  after activation of virtual environment as :-
           pip install -r file.txt
