# Python
Python is an interpreter language(a type of programming language where the code is compiled on the fly each time the program is run .)
## Anaconda Distributor 
It contains all the depencies of Python . In which , we don't want to install library . 
### In Anaconda Prompt
We give the command python , then it will give us us interface for python for coding . But there , It is for a little time . Our code is not saved in file . So , It is not a best way of coding .
## Colab
It provides us online environment to execute python with all it's depencies . 
# Extension of file
The extension of python file is .py 
# Command to run it in the Anaconda prompt 
            python file-name

# Jupyter Notebook 
It helps us to run our code individually . It helps us to divide our code in segment , that hels us in time saving .  
# Google Colab 
we make a notebook like as a jupiter Note to write a code on it .
